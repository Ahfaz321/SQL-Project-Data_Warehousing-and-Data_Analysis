# SQL-Project-Data_Warehousing-and-Data_Analysis

Welcome to the SQL Project: Data Warehousing and Data Analysis

This project is a customized version inspired by [DataWithBaraa’s SQL tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSKVgrwhzus&t=81459s). I’m using his video series as a reference to build my own version, with several modifications.

The goal is to design a comprehensive data warehouse that supports advanced data modeling for business analysis using SQL Server. This includes implementing ETL processes to transform raw data into meaningful insights.
